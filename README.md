# Commandos.exe
# note: this guy is scammer so i posted the malware not obfuscated 
 Commandos.exe deletes the entire system and also skips running as administrator, and when it is closed from the process, it deletes the entire system and is characterized by its small size, as you can transfer it to the victimsâ€™ devices easily , I disclaim all liability for any misuse of this software
